      <h2>Facts</h2>
      <p>Joseph "Erap" Estrada, the 13th President of the Philippines, faced charges of plunder and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (RA 3019) before the Sandiganbayan. The charges related to his alleged accumulation of unexplained wealth during his presidency (1998–2001), totaling approximately ₱4.2 billion through gambling operations, illegal drug trade participation, and diversion of government funds.</p>

      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <p>Whether President Estrada violated the Plunder Law (RA 7080) and the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act through the accumulation of unexplained wealth and improper receipt of funds and benefits while holding office.</p>

      <h2>Ruling</h2>
      <p>On November 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan found Estrada <strong>guilty of plunder</strong> and sentenced him to reclusion perpetua (life imprisonment). However, on December 24, 2010, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo granted him a conditional pardon. The Supreme Court eventually upheld the pardon in 2016 under the doctrine of presidential prerogative on mercy.</p>

      <h2>Key legal principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plunder Law (RA 7080):</strong> Illicit enrichment by public officials through acts amounting to at least ₱50 million constitutes plunder.</li>
        <li><strong>Mens rea (guilty mind):</strong> The prosecution must prove the official's intent to enrich themselves illegally.</li>
        <li><strong>Presidential pardon:</strong> The President's power to pardon is constitutional and inherent, subject to limited judicial review.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practical takeaways</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Transparency in governance:</strong> Public officials must maintain detailed, accurate records of income and assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability mechanisms:</strong> The Sandiganbayan, OMBUDSMAN, and NBI are institutional checks on executive power.</li>
        <li><strong>Limits of pardons:</strong> While the President can pardon convicted individuals, such pardons may affect public perception of justice.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-corruption frameworks:</strong> RA 3019 and RA 7080 are critical tools for combating corruption.</li>
      </ol>
