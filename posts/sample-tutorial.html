      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>CSC Form 212 (Application for Employment) is used by job seekers registering with the Civil Service Commission (CSC) for government employment opportunities. This tutorial walks through each field with examples to ensure you complete it correctly the first time.</p>

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A copy of your Personal Data Sheet (PDS) or birth certificate</li>
        <li>Educational certificates and diplomas</li>
        <li>Work experience records or employment history</li>
        <li>Valid government ID</li>
        <li>Contact information (email and phone)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Visual reference — sample forms</h3>
      <p>Below are representative images to help you identify the PDS and SALN sections when filling forms.</p>

      <h2>Step 1 — Prepare documents</h2>
      <p>Gather all necessary identification and educational documents. Make photocopies of each document to keep for your records. Ensure all documents are current and valid.</p>

      <h2>Step 2 — Complete personal data</h2>
      <p>Fill in your full name, address, birthdate, and contact information clearly. If you are submitting printed copies, use block letters to ensure readability. Double-check spelling of your name—it must match official documents exactly.</p>

      <h2>Step 3 — Educational attainment</h2>
      <p>List all schools attended from elementary through the highest level completed. Include the year of graduation and any honors received (Dean's List, cum laude, etc.).</p>

      <h2>Step 4 — Work experience</h2>
      <p>Enter employment history in reverse chronological order (most recent first). Include company name, position held, duration, and key responsibilities. Leave no gaps in employment; if you were not working, note "Unemployed" with dates.</p>

      <h2>Step 5 — Certifications and training</h2>
      <p>List any professional certifications, seminars, or training courses relevant to your field. This strengthens your application.</p>

      <h2>Step 6 — Signature and submission</h2>
      <p>Sign and date the form in the designated area. Make a copy for yourself. Submit the original to the CSC office or authorized partner (e.g., civil registrar).</p>

      <h2>Download and templates</h2>
      <p>The official CSC Form 212 can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.csc.gov.ph/" target="_blank">CSC website</a> or obtained at any CSC office. Keep a blank copy for future reference.</p>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Incomplete or illegible handwriting</li>
        <li>Misspelled names or addresses</li>
        <li>Missing or outdated employment dates</li>
        <li>Unsigned forms</li>
        <li>Submitting without required supporting documents</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>After submission, your application will be processed by the CSC. You will receive a notice of acceptance or a request for additional information. Keep your CSC application number for tracking and future inquiries.</p>
