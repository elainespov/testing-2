      <h2>Why travel light</h2>
      <p>Traveling minimally isn't just about packing less—it's about experiencing more. In Palawan, one of the Philippines' most stunning destinations, the best memories come from freedom of movement, not from accumulated luggage. This guide shows you how to island-hop through Palawan with just a backpack, making the most of every moment and every peso.</p>

      <h2>Itinerary</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Day 1: Puerto Princesa city tour</strong> — Arrive early, explore the baywalk, try local seafood, and settle into your accommodation.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 2: Underground River + island transfer</strong> — Book a tour of the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River, then transfer by boat to your island resort.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 3: Island hopping and sunset</strong> — Snorkel at multiple islands, enjoy fresh catches for lunch, and watch the sunset over the sea.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What to pack (minimalist edition)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pair of quick-dry shorts</li>
        <li>2 lightweight t-shirts</li>
        <li>1 sundress or light shirt</li>
        <li>Swimsuit and reef-safe sunscreen</li>
        <li>Light jacket for cooler evenings</li>
        <li>Flip-flops and water shoes</li>
        <li>Essential toiletries and medications</li>
        <li>Phone charger and portable power bank</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practical tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Book boats in advance during high season (December–April) to avoid last-minute hassles.</li>
        <li>Bring reef-safe sunscreen to protect the marine ecosystem.</li>
        <li>Carry a small first-aid kit and photocopies of your ID and travel documents.</li>
        <li>Use cash (PHP) for small transactions; not all island vendors accept cards.</li>
        <li>Learn basic Filipino phrases—locals appreciate the effort and it opens doors.</li>
        <li>Pack snacks and plenty of water; island shops are limited and prices are higher.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Budget breakdown</h2>
      <p>For a 3-day island-hopping trip on a tight budget:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accommodation (mid-range resort): ₱3,000–₱5,000/night</li>
        <li>Island tour package: ₱1,500–₱2,500</li>
        <li>Meals: ₱1,000–₱1,500/day</li>

      </ul>
      <p><strong>Total: approximately ₱10,000–₱15,000 (USD 180–270) for one person for 3 days</strong></p>

      <h2>Cultural notes</h2>
      <p>Palawan is home to the indigenous Palauan people and several other ethnic groups. Respect local customs, ask permission before photographing people, and support local businesses whenever possible. The islands are fragile ecosystems—take only memories, leave only footprints.</p>
